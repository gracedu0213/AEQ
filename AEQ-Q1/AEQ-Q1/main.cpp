//1. one can alwasy build a castle at the end of the array, given that the array is non-empty
//      1.1 if the array has size of one, the first and the last element is the same, and thereby complying with the first assumption
//      1.2 if the last element n is different from the previous element, one castle can be built
//      1.3 if the last element is the same as the previous element, then one castle can be build on the sequence
//2. a sequence of elements with the same value is considered as "flat ground"
